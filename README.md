# Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis

This repository contains my project on **time series forecasting and analysis**, carried out as part of **Google Developer Group | IIT Kanpur (Decâ€™23 â€“ Janâ€™24)**.  
The project focuses on applying both **classical statistical models** and **deep learning approaches** to financial time series forecasting.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Highlights
- **Data preprocessing & augmentation**:  
  Applied techniques such as  
  - Resampling  
  - Rolling-window feature engineering  
  - Differencing & detrending  
  - Seasonal decomposition  
  to stabilize the series and reveal underlying trend/seasonal components.

- **Modeling approach**:  
  - Implemented a reproducible **training & evaluation pipeline**.  
  - Benchmarked a **SARIMA baseline** against **Seq-to-Seq LSTM models** in TensorFlow.  

- **Results**:  
  - Improved short-term forecast accuracy on held-out **AAPL stock data**.  
  - **MAPE = 3%** (7-day horizon) vs. naÃ¯ve baseline of **4%**.
